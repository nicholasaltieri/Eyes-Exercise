# Eyes Exercise
 Document Object Module Manipulation
 
 This exercise emphasizes using JavaScript to manipulate the document object module and its elements. It also touches on css styling principles.
 
 The 'eyes' in this file consist of a pair of divs styled to represent a pair of eyes. We used JavaScript mouse events to program the eyes to follow the mouse in the DOM.
